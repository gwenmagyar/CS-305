1. Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and its software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did the company want you to address?

Client: The client is Artemis Financial, a company likely focused on financial services.
Software Requirements: Artemis Financial required a secure web application capable of protecting client data and financial information during transmission and storage.
Issue: The primary issue Artemis Financial wanted to address was securing their data transmission and ensuring the integrity of data by implementing encryption and secure communication protocols.

2. What did you do well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities?

The process of identifying and addressing vulnerabilities was handled through thorough code reviews and threat modeling. The implementation of Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) and SHA-256 checksum verification, along with the setup of HTTPS for secure communications, were well-executed steps to mitigate risks and enhance data security.

3. Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall well-being?

Secure coding is crucial because it protects against data breaches, unauthorized access, and other security threats. It adds significant value to a company by ensuring the integrity and confidentiality of sensitive information, maintaining compliance with regulations, and fostering customer trust, which in turn enhances the company's reputation and operational efficiency.

4. Which part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?

The document emphasizes the critical steps of setting up secure communication (HTTPS) and implementing SHA-256 for data integrity, which were challenging but vital in ensuring the security of the application. The thorough testing process, including static and functional analysis, was particularly helpful in verifying that no new vulnerabilities were introduced.

5. How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?

Layers of security were increased by implementing AES-256 encryption, SHA-256 checksum verification, and HTTPS for secure communication. In the future, similar techniques like static code analysis, dynamic testing, and the use of tools such as OWASP Dependency-Check could be employed to assess vulnerabilities and decide on mitigation strategies.

6. How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?

The refactored code was verified through functional testing and static code analysis. These processes ensured that the code was both functional and free of newly introduced vulnerabilities, maintaining the security of the application.

7. What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?

Resources and tools like AES-256 encryption, SHA-256 checksum verification, HTTPS setup, static code analysis tools (e.g., OWASP Dependency-Check), and secure coding practices were utilized. These tools and practices are crucial for future assignments that require a focus on secure software development.

8. Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?

Future employers might be impressed by examples showing the successful implementation of AES encryption, secure communication setup with HTTPS, thorough testing processes, and the application of industry-standard best practices for secure software development. The ability to identify and address vulnerabilities proactively and ensure compliance with security protocols would be valuable to highlight.
